# Jobs-Jobs-Jobs
Where is easier to find a job?
<br>
In this project I will use python and selenium to loop through all Indeed's web pages along all countries<br>
to extract the job count of each country and put it against the population of the respective country.<br>

main.ipynb is where the web scraping and data analisys is.<br>
csvData.csv is the document where I extracted the world population.<br>
Worldwideperperson2.csv is the Result of the analisys.
